/**
 * The main class requires:
 * (1) a Supplier<V> of objects of some type T, for example by reading from a file, and
 * (2) a Comparator<V>
 * (3) a choice for k
 * (4) an instance of KNNDescent<V>
 * (5) an instance of CohesionGraphBuilder<V>
 * What it delivers is
 * (a) a list of components of the cluster graph, and sizes
 * (b) a getter that retrieves the one- or two-step neighborhood (in the cohesion graph) of a given object as a file readable for graph display.
